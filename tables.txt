Factory tables for Acelgoyobis - description


The Cave

- Death Gate: a gate initially closing the way to the pit on the bottom left.
  - opened by hitting the circle on the right lane
  - closed by hitting the square on the top left
- Multiplier: hit the four sides of the diamond in the middle, then a plus sign
  appears in a circle in the shortcut of the top left corner. Hitting the plus
  sign increases the bonus multiplier by one.
- Pearls: hit the pearls on the top part for some points
- Left lane targets: same as pearls
- Mask ride:
  - clearing the cavity next to the notice 'The Cave' makes a torch appear
  - hitting the torch makes a coin appear on the topmost lane
  - hitting the coin makes the gadgets in the cavity reappear, and the fifth
    coin reveals the mask on the left and opens its way
  - collecting the mask closes its gate and gets you a lot of points
- Rubber surfaces: the wall near the letter 'E', above the right flipper


Gaia

- Series: there are three series of identical objects visible; hitting them
  gives you some points and only clearing them each makes them reappear
- Flower race: there are 7 flowers on the table, but only one is visible at a
  time; initially this is on the inner left lane connecting the top and the
  bottom; hitting one makes the next one appear, but failing to hit each of
  them in a certain time after the previous one returns the initial state.
  Successive flowers are worth more and more, and some reveal some extra
  targets that don't diminish with time:
  - the 4th one activates the apple (extra score)
  - the 5th one activates the grape (extra score)
  - the 6th one activates the pear (extra score)
  - the 7th one gives you an extra bonus multiplier besides a lot of points
- Multiplier: the standard way to get the multiplier is to shoot the ball up
  through the right lane (right next to the launching lane), having it fall
  down on the lane with the first flower without falling down first through any
  other place. This reveals the multiplier indicated by a blinking arrow. If
  you get the ball to the top part on a different lane, the target disappears
  before you can collect it.
- Rubber surfaces: the upper half of the wall piece surrounded by the bottom
  right corner


Astrolab

- Multiplier: clear the five rocks in the top part, and a diamond-shaped
  mineral appears in the hole next to the left lane. Hit it for an increased
  multiplier.
- Astronaut: get the three capsules in the vertical lanes of the bottom part,
  and you can collect the astronaut in the rightmost hole.
- Derelict: hit all the four pieces next to the astronaut's hole. When done,
  the scout ship in the centre will be equipped. Hit all the four pieces of 
  equipment, and a transport ship appears in the lane next to the starting
  pipe. Collecting the transport reveals the derelict in the top part. Just hit 
  it and you're set.
- Trap: there is a trap on the left with a gate that's periodically opened and 
  closed. Avoid it when the gate is hidden, otherwise you can easily lose your 
  ball.
- Rubber surfaces: the bumpers above each flipper


Speed (by Maarten Zwartbol)

- Speeding Ticket: collect all the arrows on the bottom to activate the
  Speeding Ticket! If you fail to collect the Speeding Ticket within some
  seconds... it will be deactivated. 
- Tire: there are 4 spikestrips located on the table. Collecting all the
  spikestrips will activate the Tire. If you fail to collect the Tire within
  some seconds... it will be deactivated. 
- Small Suspension Quest: collect the shards lying on the surface of the left
  'bumper' to activate the small suspension gizmo on the right. If you collect
  the small suspension gizmo by entering the lane from the top the quest will
  be deactivated. So only enter the lane trough the bottom 2 entrances. 
- Big Suspension Quest: if you finished the Small Suspension Quest the shards
  on the right bumper will be activated. Collecting these shards will activate
  the big suspension gizmo in the left lane. 
- Fast Lap: if you go round the whole top lane (enter from left, exit on right)
  you will collect some points. If you pick up the Flag which will be activated
  you gain a lot more points. If you fail to collect the Flag within some
  seconds... surprise, it will be deactivated. 
- Multiplier: if you finished 10 quests the Cup will be activated. Collecting
  it will increase your Bonus multiplier and give you a lot of points! If you
  fail to collect the Cup, once activated, within some seconds.. guess what
  happens. 
- Rubber surfaces: the bumpers above each flipper and the holes to the left
  and right of the flippers.
